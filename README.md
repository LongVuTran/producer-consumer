## Summary
This simulation was to help learn about threading in C using producers and consumers. Producers create and place an int in a buffer. Consumers will attempt to remove ints from the buffer. 

## Compilation Instructions
* Run `$ make` to compile.
* Run `$ ./pc x y x` where x,y, and z is some integer specifying the sleep time, number of producers, number of consumers.
